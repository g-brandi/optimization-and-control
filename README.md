# Multi-Objective Optimization for the Fixed Charge Transportation Problem
This repository contains the results of the final project within the Optimization and Control course as part of the Master's Degree program in Automation Engineering at Polytechnic University of Bari. The core of this project is to address the complex challenges inherent in transportation systems, where multiple objectives must be balanced simultaneously, using MATLAB to explore innovative strategies for optimizing transportation operations.

## Overview
Transportation poses a crucial challenge for many economic and logistical activities, often involving multiple objectives or criteria that must be satisfied. These objectives may include minimizing costs, maximizing resource utilization, reducing delivery times and lessening environmental impact. Within this context, a multi-objective optimization model tailored for the Fixed Charge Transportation Problem (FCTP) has been developed, along with the application of a genetic algorithm to characterize the Pareto front of the objective functions. The results obtained demonstrate a high efficienty in determining compromise solutions, thereby enhancing the understanding and management of complex transportation problems.
